# 2023-HiMCM-A-Dandelion-Problem
1. Introduction.
1.1 Background and Problem Context.
The common dandelion is a Eurasian species that is now found nearly worldwide. It is commonly seen in lawns, fields, and cities in temperate, dry, and warm places. Because of its ability to successfully reproduce and disperse, people essentially engage with this plant species. The dandelion is considered a stubborn weed by many. It is an invasive species that colonises well-kept lawns and takes over the vital resources of turf grasses. Furthermore, it is one of the most difficult plants to kill.  From an agricultural point of view, it has the ability to carry certain crop diseases which might bring damages to local system. This view rates it as an enemy. On the other hand, dandelions were widely used in traditional medicine and food. Every part of the plant is edible. The leaves are used in salads. The roots can be roasted and used as coffee substitutes. The flowers are used for making wine. It has been used as a diuretic and source of vitamins and minerals. The dandelion’s dual nature as a pesty invader and a useful resource makes it essential  for a study on “invasiveness.”

1.2 Problem Restatement and Analysis.
The specific tasks are.
To create a mathematical model that predicts the spread of a dandelion population in its puff-ball stage from a single plant over a hectare of open land. The model should provide specific predictions of area covered and/or population density at 1,2,3,6 and 12 months. The model must also be applicable in temperate, arid, and tropical climates since which the growth and dispersal parameters differ.
One of our objectives is to create a strong quantitative model of the "impact factor" of an invasive plant. The model needs to integrate a broad spectrum of information regarding the characteristics of the organism it relates to (including its life-cycle, shedding potential, etc.) as well as the type and level of damage it is likely to inflict on the environment, economy and human health.
a. We will use this model to determine the specific impact factor of the dandelion.
b. To further apply the model to two other plant-specific invasive species, clearly state which is considered invasive to which region.
According to our analysis, this is a problem that can be solved through a spatial simulation model that can address the predictive problem of population ecology in the first task. The second task requires a multi-criteria assessment evaluative problem, with a framework that can weight and combine disparate, often qualitative, variables into some rough equivalent.
Our Work Overview and Model.
In order to solve these problems, we are going to do the following process.
For Task 1 , we will employ Cellular Automata modeling.  A plot of land that is 1 hectare will be broken down into several grid cells. Every cell can be in a state that represents a different stage in the life of a dandelion for example, the stages could be empty seed, seed, seedling, mature plant etc. The model will operate on a monthly time step. Probabilities that govern transitions from one state to another will come from dandelions. The chance of germination of a seed and maturity of a seedling will be governed by climate dependent coefficients (temperature, moisture, soil quality and solar radiation).The mature plant produces the seed every month of blooming. The model calculates the probability of dandelion survival in each cell through a weighted synthesis of key environmental parameters. This probability directly governs the state transition rules of the cellular automata.

For task 2 : 
To quantify the comprehensive impact of dandelion invasion, we developed a weighted evaluation model that systematically assesses dimensions through  analysis. For human impacts, we established a system that assigns weighted values to negative effects and positive contributions such as medicinal value and nutritional benefits.  For ecological impacts, we quantified resource competition indices measuring appropriation of soil nutrients, water, and sunlight, alongside evaluating effects on food webs by analyzing shifts in herbivore foraging patterns and biodiversity metrics. These separate assessments are integrated through a multi-criteria decision matrix, employing entropy-based weighting to balance the relative importance of each factor, ultimately generating a unified Invasion Impact Index that accurately reflects the species' complex ecological role.

2. Assumptions and Justifications.
To make our complex biological and environmental system a manageable mathematical model, we propose the following justifiable assumptions. The complex nature of this problem allows for many assumptions to be made that affect dandelions dispersal and effect.
1 The one hectare plot is homogenous and flat.
Justification:​​ This assumption is fundamental for establishing a controlled modeling environment that allows us to analyze the dispersal mechanisms of dandelions without the confounding variables introduced by landscape differences. In reality, natural terrains feature variations in topography, soil composition, moisture retention, and other coexisting vegetation, all of which can significantly influence seed settlement, germination, and plant growth. By assuming homogeneity, we create a theoretical baseline scenario that focuses exclusively on the species' reproductive potential and dispersal dynamics under uniform conditions. The model's output, therefore, represents a null hypothesis of spread, which can be compared against observed patterns in complex landscapes to identify and quantify the specific effects of various environmental factors.
2 Seed germination rates are constant over time and space.​
Justification: We assume that all seeds germination success depends only on environmental conditions modeled through climate modifiers. In reality, seed germination is influenced by many conditions. However, given the short timeframe and homogeneous plot assumption, holding these factors constant reduces complexity of the problem. Therefore through this assumption, we can simply the problem and focus on the impact of dandelion to the ecosystem
3 Human interventions are absent.​
Justification: This assumption allows the model to simulate the natural, unmanaged spread of dandelions, providing a baseline understanding of their invasive potential. In real-world settings, human activities can significantly suppress populations, but their exclusion here helps isolate and quantify the biological invasion dynamics independent of human control efforts.
4 the seed will only be spread by winds
Justification: While dandelion seeds can sometimes be spread by animals or water, studies indicate that wind is the dominant and most effective dispersal vector for this species, particularly in open habitats.  Focusing on this mechanism simplifies the model while capturing the primary driver of spread.
